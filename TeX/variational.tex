\section{Variational}
 Now we focus on using the integration to solve the problem established in the introduction.
 Using the Monte Carlo integration we focused on three different problems, the harmonic oscillator,
 hydrogen atom and helium atom.

\subsection{Harmonic Oscillator}
The Hamiltonian of the harmonic oscillator is
\begin{align*}
  \hat{H} = \frac{-1}{2}\frac{\partial^2}{ \partial x^2} + \frac{1}{2} x^2.
\end{align*}
Where we choose the trial wave function as
  \begin{align*}
    \Psi_T = e^{-\alpha x^2}.
  \end{align*}
From this we can derive tha local energy
  \begin{align*}
    E_L = \alpha + x^2(\frac{1}{2} - 2\alpha^2).
  \end{align*}
Where that based on the local energy we can already determine that
$\alpha = \frac{1}{2}$ gives us the ground state ($E_L = E_0 = \frac{1}{2}$),
because in that case the variance of the local energy is equal to zero.
It is nonetheless a good test for our algorithm to see if we can find the expected value of $E_0 = \frac{1}{2}$
using Monte Carlo integration.

\subsection{Hydrogen Atom}
We will now consider the Hydrogen atom, where the Hamiltonian is
\begin{align}
  \hat{H} = \frac{-1}{2}\nabla^2 - \frac{1}{r}.
\end{align}

We choose the trial wave function as
  \begin{align}
    \Psi_T = e^{-\alpha r}.
  \end{align}
This leads the a local energy
  \begin{align}
    E_L(r) = - \frac{1}{r} - \frac{1}{2}\alpha(\alpha - \frac{2}{r})
  \end{align}

Here, too, we notice that from inspection it is clear that $\alpha = 1$ yields the ground state energy of $E_L = E_0 = -\frac{1}{2}$.

\subsection{Helium Atom}
Finally we consider the Hamiltonian for the helium atom,
\begin{align}
  \hat{H} = -\frac{1}{2}(\nabla_{r_1}^2 + \nabla_{r_3}^2 + 2\nabla_{r_1}\cdot \nabla_{r_2}) - \frac{1}{r}.
\end{align}
Where will we use the trial function
  \begin{align}
    \Psi_T (\textbf{r}_1,\textbf{r}_2) = e^{2r_1}e^{2r_2}e^{\frac{r_{12}}{2(1+\alpha r_{12}}}
  \end{align}

where $r_{12} = |\textbf{r}_1 - \textbf{r}_2 |$. This trial function is applied to the following Hamiltonian:


This leads a 'beautiful' equation for the local energy:
  \begin{align}
    E_L(\textbf{r}_1,\textbf{r}_2) = -4  + (\hat{\textbf{r}}_1 - \hat{\textbf{r}}_2) \cdot (\textbf{r}_1 - \textbf{r}_2) \frac{1}{r_{12}(1+\alpha r_{12})^2} -  \frac{1}{r_{12}(1+\alpha r_{12})^3} - \frac{1}{r_{12}(4(1+\alpha r_{12}))^4} + \frac{1}{r_{1,2}}   \end{align}
