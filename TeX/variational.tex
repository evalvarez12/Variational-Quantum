\section{Variational}
 Now we focus on using the integration to solve the problem established in the introduction.
 Using the Monte Carlo integration we focused on three different problems, the harmonic oscillator,
 hydrogen atom and helium atom.

\subsection{Harmonic Oscillator}
  For the harmonic oscillator the trial wave function is
  \begin{align}
    \Psi_T = e^{-\alpha x^2}
  \end{align}

  The Hamiltonian is
  \begin{align}
    \hat{H} = \frac{-1}{2}\frac{\partial^2}{ \partial x^2} + \frac{1}{2} x^2
  \end{align}
