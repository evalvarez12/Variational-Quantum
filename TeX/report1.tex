\begin{abstract}

Monte Carlo simulations in combination with the variational method is a powerful tool for numerically finding ground states of quantum systems that don't have an analytic solution. In this work we examine and implement this method to approximate the ground states and the associated energies for a one-dimensional harmonic oscillator, a Hydrogen atom and a Helium atom. In order to achieve that goal, different numerical integration methods are examined. In the case of the harmonic oscillator and the hydrogen atom, relative errors in energy smaller than $10^{-5}$ could easily be obtained. For helium much larger errors were observed, since the inter-electron interaction was only approximated with a very simple test-function. Still, the results show that our implementation of the Monte Carlo methods can produce results that are comparable to other methods, even for multi-electron systems.
