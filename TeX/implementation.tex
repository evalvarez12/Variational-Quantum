\section{Implementation}

To realize the Monte Carlo integration we explored different methods and compared the results obtained
in order to gain a better insight on how to create a better general integrator. Each method differs in how
the points in the domain are taken to evaluate the integral.

\subsection{Different Methods}

The following integrtion schemes \cite{MCmethods} were used for comparison:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Uniform mesh - The sample points are taken in a uniform mesh trough th entire domain.
  \item Adaptive - The domain is divided uniformly in square boxes, for each box a meshgrid is created
  specified by a density value which specifies the total number of points inside the box.
  \item Stratified - The entire domain is divided in a uniform mesh, where for each quadrant of the mesh
  a single point is choosen randomly inside.
  \item AdaptiveStratified - Basically a combination of both methods adaptive and stratified.
\end{enumerate}

To compare each we used a test function on which we evaluated the different integrals.
The test function consisted on a donut shaped  in a 2-dimensional domain. The resulting
sample points for each method are shown in fig. \ref{} and the table below shows the error
obtained in each case.
